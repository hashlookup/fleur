# Fleur - A bloom filter implementation in C
Fleur implements a Bloom Filter library that is fully compatible with DCSO's [Go](https://github.com/DCSO/bloom) and [python](https://github.com/DCSO/flor) implementations.

# Requirements
- gcc version supporting C11
- [cmake](https://ninja-build.org/)
- [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

Fleur has only been tested under Ubuntu 20.04
```
sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build gcc
```

# Compilation
```
git clone git@github.com:hashlookup/fleur.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -GNinja -DTARGET_GROUP=production . 
ninja -v
```

# Running tests
```
cmake -GNinja -DTARGET_GROUP=test . 
ninja -v
```
Each suite test's executable are then located under `./test/suite_n`.

# LibFleur usage
```
struct BloomFilter fleur_initialize(uint64_t n, double p, char *buf);
struct BloomFilter fleur_bloom_filter_from_file(FILE* f);

int fleur_add(BloomFilter * bf, char *buf, size_t buf_size);
int fleur_check(BloomFilter * bf, char *buf, size_t buf_size);
void fleur_set_data(BloomFilter * bf, char* buf, size_t buf_size );
void fleur_bloom_filter_to_file(BloomFilter * bf, FILE* of);
void fleur_fingerprint(BloomFilter * bf, char *buf, size_t buf_size, uint64_t **fingerprint);

void fleur_print_header(header * h);
void fleur_print_filter(BloomFilter * bf);
int fleur_check_header(header * h);
```

# Fleur command line tool usage

NAME:
   Fleurcli - Utility to work with bloom filters

USAGE:
   fleurcli [-c] command [command options] [arguments...] bloomfilter.file

VERSION:
   0.1

COMMANDS:
     create         Create a new Bloom filter and store it in the given filename.
     insert         Inserts new values into an existing Bloom filter.
     check          Checks values against an existing Bloom filter.
     set-data       Sets the data associated with the Bloom filter.
     get-data       Prints the data associated with the Bloom filter.
     show           Shows various details about a given Bloom filter.
```
